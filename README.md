- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualize patterns and relationships in the dataset.

- **Model training & evaluation**  
  Train ML models, evaluate using metrics, and save the trained pipeline.

- **ML pipeline**  
  Modularized pipeline using Python scripts for better maintainability.

- **Model logging & tracking**  
  Integrated MLflow (or similar) for tracking experiments.

- **Packaging & serving**  
  Flask API exposing endpoints for predictions via HTML forms and JSON.

- **Containerization**  
  Dockerfile for building a containerized ML inference service.

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
